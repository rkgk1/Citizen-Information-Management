# Citizen Information Management

## Overview
**Citizen Information Management** is a Java-based application designed to manage general information of citizens, including full names, addresses, email addresses, and other pertinent details. This project serves as a prototype to test and enhance proficiency in **Java Swing**, a part of the Java Foundation Classes used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The use of **JavaFX** or other plugins is deliberately restricted to ensure a focused learning experience with **Java Swing**.

## Project Details
This project is developed as part of the academic requirements for the **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at **Saint Louis University**. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of Java programming and GUI development, offering a practical approach to managing citizen information.

### Features
- **Information Management**: Store and manage general information such as full name, address, email, and additional details.
- **User Interface**: Utilize **Java Swing** to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure non-editable and non-selectable lists for secure information handling.
- **Profile View**: Display detailed citizen profiles with images, incorporating a clear and organized layout.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust understanding of **Java Swing** for GUI development.
- Create a functional prototype for managing citizen information.
- Apply best practices in software development and data management.
- Fulfill the academic requirements for the **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at **Saint Louis University**.
  
## Usage
This program is intended for educational purposes, providing a practical application for learning **Java Swing**. It is a prototype and should not be used for managing real-world citizen information without further development and security enhancements.

## Acknowledgments
This project is completed as part of the course requirements at **Saint Louis University**, under the guidance and supervision of the faculty in the Computer Science department. Special thanks to all who contributed to the learning and development process.
